## 🚗 Rev Up for the Ultimate Racing Challenge! 🚴‍♂️
In this high-speed racing adventure, your goal is to complete a set number of laps (REQUIRED_LAPS) on an elliptical track within a time limit (TOTAL_TIME). Choose your vehicle—bike or car—and tackle a track filled with cones, potholes, power-ups, power-downs, and banana pills. Avoid collisions that drain your health, grab power-ups to boost your speed, and brace for the control-reversing chaos of banana pills. The game features a sleek HUD displaying time, laps, speed, health, and active effects, making every race a pulse-pounding experience.
