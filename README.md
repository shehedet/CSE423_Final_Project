# CSE423_Final_Project

## 🚗 Rev Up for the Ultimate Racing Challenge! 🚴‍♂️
Hey there, I’m a passionate game developer crafting thrilling experiences with Python and OpenGL! My flagship project is a high-speed 2D racing game where you can race bikes or cars around an elliptical track, dodging cones, potholes, and tricky banana pills that flip your controls for a wild ride. Boost your speed with power-ups, navigate time-stealing power-downs, and compete to complete laps before the clock runs out. With smooth physics, a dynamic HUD, and first- or third-person views, it’s a race you won’t want to miss!
